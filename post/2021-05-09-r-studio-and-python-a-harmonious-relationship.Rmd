### Combining Two Electronic Languages to Show School Spirit 

Have you ever tried combining two different languages to convey one message? What language was it?   

While many people may think of verbal languages such as spainish, french, chinese, or portuguese when I ask this question, I would like to present even more impressive languages to try this with. R Studio and Python are two distinct high-level programming languages used by many organizations for the purpose of data sciences. While these platforms are separate, they have the unique ability to communicate and work together to provide a singular output.

For example, proud Texas Longhorns often use the phrase, "Hook 'em", to show their school spirit. To use this phrase electronically through R Studio AND Python, you must start by using an r code chunk to load up the package 'reticulate' within the R Studio platform. This package provides a set of tools for interoperability between Python and R Studio. Since we are using the r code chunk, we follow this step by defining the word "Hook" as the object 'go' using R Studio language. R Studio uses arrows to assign objects. 


```{r}
library(reticulate)
go <-"Hook"
```

Afterwards, go ahead and use a python chunk within R Studio to define the word "'em" as 'longhorns'. Follow this by using the Python function "print()" to print a specified message to the screen. Since our first word is coded in R Studio language and we are using a Python chunk, place 'r.go' as the first object within print, then 'longhorns' as the second. Run the function and view your output!

```{python}
longhorns="'em"
print(r.go,longhorns)
```

Just to further prove the functionality of these two platforms, an r chunk is shown below to provide the same output. The concatenate function in R Studio works like print, as it converts its arguments to character vectors. This time, no need to use the 'r.go' code, since we are now working under R Studio. Instead, place 'go' as the first argument, then use 'py$longhorns' as the second argument to specify that you are using Python code for the second message. Run this function, and you should see the same output!

```{r}
cat(c(go,py$longhorns))
```

The possibility of unique messages using the two languages are endless, go knock yourself out!
Oh, and Hook 'em!
